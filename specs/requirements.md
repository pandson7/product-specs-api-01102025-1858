# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a Product Specifications API that provides access to product data stored in a flexible JSON schema database. The API will serve product information including name, category, brand, and other attributes through RESTful endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Product Data Storage
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to store product specifications in a flexible JSON format, so that I can accommodate varying product attributes without schema constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN product data is stored in the database THE SYSTEM SHALL support flexible JSON schema with varying attributes
2. WHEN storing product specifications THE SYSTEM SHALL include core fields: product name, category, brand, and additional custom attributes
3. WHEN sample data is created THE SYSTEM SHALL populate the database with representative product records

### Requirement 2: API Endpoint for Product Retrieval
**User Story:** As a client application, I want to retrieve product specifications via REST API, so that I can display product information to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a GET request is made to /products THE SYSTEM SHALL return all product specifications in JSON format
2. WHEN a GET request is made to /products/{id} THE SYSTEM SHALL return a specific product's specifications
3. WHEN no products exist THE SYSTEM SHALL return an empty array with HTTP 200 status
4. WHEN a product ID doesn't exist THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 404 status

### Requirement 3: API Response Format
**User Story:** As a client developer, I want consistent API response formats, so that I can reliably parse and use the product data.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN API returns product data THE SYSTEM SHALL use consistent JSON structure
2. WHEN API encounters errors THE SYSTEM SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
3. WHEN API returns multiple products THE SYSTEM SHALL include pagination metadata if applicable

### Requirement 4: Sample Data Population
**User Story:** As a developer, I want sample product data in the system, so that I can test API functionality immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the system is deployed THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically populate sample product data
2. WHEN sample data is created THE SYSTEM SHALL include diverse product categories and brands
3. WHEN API is tested THE SYSTEM SHALL return the populated sample data successfully
